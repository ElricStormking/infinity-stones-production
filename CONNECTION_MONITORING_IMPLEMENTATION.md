# Connection Monitoring Implementation - CRITICAL CASINO SECURITY

**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Prevents players from being confused about offline/online gameplay

---

## Problem Statement

In an **online casino game**, players must NEVER be allowed to continue playing when disconnected from the server. This creates several critical issues:

### Issues Before Fix:

1. **Silent demo mode fallback** - Game switched to demo mode with only a brief message
2. **Fake wins** - Players continued spinning with $5000 demo balance, thinking it was real
3. **No spin blocking** - Nothing prevented spins when disconnected
4. **No persistent warning** - Only temporary `showMessage()` that disappeared quickly
5. **Balance confusion** - Demo balance ($5000) replaced real balance
6. **Transaction disputes** - Players claimed wins that never happened on server
7. **Regulatory compliance** - Casino games must block gameplay when disconnected

### Root Causes:

```javascript
// BEFORE: Silent fallback to demo mode
switchToDemoMode() {
    this.serverMode = false;
    this.demoMode = true;
    this.showMessage('Server error - switched to demo mode'); // Only 2 seconds!
    this.ensureDemoBalance(); // Give $5000 fake credits
}

// BEFORE: No connection check in spin logic
async startSpin() {
    if (this.isSpinning) return;
    // ... NO CONNECTION CHECK ...
    this.processServerSpin(); // Fails silently
}
```

## Solution: Connection Monitor System

Implemented a comprehensive connection monitoring system that:

1. ‚úÖ **Blocks all spins** for authenticated players when disconnected
2. ‚úÖ **Shows persistent warning overlay** that cannot be dismissed
3. ‚úÖ **Prevents demo mode fallback** for authenticated players
4. ‚úÖ **Displays real-time connection status** indicator
5. ‚úÖ **Pings server every 5 seconds** to detect disconnections
6. ‚úÖ **Allows retry attempts** with clear UI feedback

---

## Implementation Details

### 1. New File: `src/services/ConnectionMonitor.js`

**Purpose:** Monitors server connection and blocks gameplay when disconnected

**Key Features:**

```javascript
class ConnectionMonitor {
    constructor(scene) {
        this.isConnected = false;
        this.isAuthenticated = !!localStorage.getItem('infinity_storm_token');
        this.checkInterval = 5000; // Ping every 5 seconds
        this.pingTimeout = 10000; // 10 second timeout
        
        // Start monitoring
        this.startMonitoring();
        this.createStatusIndicator(); // Top-right corner indicator
    }
    
    canSpin() {
        // CRITICAL: Authenticated players require connection
        if (this.isAuthenticated && !this.isConnected) {
            console.warn('üö´ Spin blocked - player is authenticated but disconnected');
            return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

**Connection Checking:**

```javascript
async checkConnectionStatus() {
    try {
        const response = await fetch('/health', {
            method: 'GET',
            signal: AbortSignal.timeout(10000) // 10 second timeout
        });
        
        this.isConnected = response.ok;
        
        if (wasConnected !== this.isConnected) {
            this.onConnectionChange(this.isConnected);
        }
    } catch (error) {
        this.isConnected = false;
        this.showDisconnectedWarning(); // Show persistent overlay
    }
}
```

**Persistent Warning Overlay:**

- **Dark overlay** (85% opacity) covering entire screen
- **Red warning box** with "CONNECTION LOST" title
- **Clear message** explaining situation
- **Retry button** to attempt reconnection
- **Cannot be dismissed** until connection restored
- **Blocks all input** to prevent gameplay

**Connection Status Indicator:**

- **Top-right corner** (always visible)
- **Green dot + "ONLINE"** when connected
- **Red dot + "OFFLINE"** when disconnected
- **Updates in real-time** every 5 seconds

---

### 2. Modified: `src/scenes/GameScene.js`

#### A. Initialize Connection Monitor

```javascript
// In create() method (line 132-138)
if (window.ConnectionMonitor) {
    this.connectionMonitor = new window.ConnectionMonitor(this);
    console.log('üîå ConnectionMonitor initialized');
} else {
    console.warn('‚ö†Ô∏è ConnectionMonitor not available - connection checks disabled');
}
```

#### B. Block Spins When Disconnected

```javascript
// In startSpin() method (lines 1098-1108)
async startSpin() {
    if (this.isSpinning) return;
    
    // CRITICAL: Check connection status for authenticated players
    if (this.connectionMonitor && !this.connectionMonitor.canSpin()) {
        console.error('üö´ Spin blocked - server connection required for authenticated players');
        this.showMessage('Connection lost! Please wait for reconnection.');
        
        // Ensure warning is visible
        if (!this.connectionMonitor.warningOverlay) {
            this.connectionMonitor.showDisconnectedWarning();
        }
        return; // EXIT - DO NOT ALLOW SPIN
    }
    
    // ... rest of spin logic ...
}
```

#### C. Prevent Demo Mode Fallback for Authenticated Players

```javascript
// In switchToDemoMode() method (lines 3199-3232)
switchToDemoMode() {
    // CRITICAL: Prevent demo mode fallback for authenticated players
    const authToken = localStorage.getItem('infinity_storm_token');
    if (authToken) {
        console.error('üö´ Cannot switch to demo mode - player is authenticated');
        console.log('üîí Gameplay suspended until server connection is restored');
        
        // Show persistent warning instead
        if (this.connectionMonitor) {
            this.connectionMonitor.showDisconnectedWarning();
        }
        
        // Block gameplay
        this.serverMode = true; // Keep server mode active
        this.demoMode = false; // Prevent demo mode
        this.isServerSpinning = false;
        
        return; // EXIT - DO NOT ALLOW DEMO MODE
    }
    
    // For non-authenticated players, allow demo mode
    this.serverMode = false;
    this.demoMode = true;
    // ... demo mode logic ...
}
```

#### D. Cleanup on Destroy

```javascript
// In destroy() method (lines 4645-4649)
if (this.connectionMonitor && this.connectionMonitor.destroy) {
    this.connectionMonitor.destroy();
    this.connectionMonitor = null;
}
```

### 3. Modified: `index.html`

Added ConnectionMonitor script to load order:

```html
<!-- Line 191 -->
<script src="src/services/NetworkService.js"></script>
<script src="src/services/ConnectionMonitor.js"></script> <!-- NEW -->
<script src="src/services/SessionService.js"></script>
```

## User Experience Flow

### Scenario 1: Player Loses Connection During Gameplay

1. **Connection lost** (internet drops, server down, etc.)
2. **Within 5 seconds**, ConnectionMonitor detects disconnection
3. **Status indicator** changes to red "OFFLINE"
4. **If player tries to spin**:
   - Spin is **blocked immediately**
   - **Persistent warning overlay** appears:
     ```
     ‚ö†Ô∏è
     CONNECTION LOST
     
     You have been disconnected from the server.
     All gameplay is suspended until connection is restored.
     
     Please check your internet connection.
     
     [RETRY CONNECTION]
     ```
5. **Player clicks "RETRY CONNECTION"**:
   - Attempts to ping server
   - If successful: Overlay closes, "Connection restored" message, gameplay resumes
   - If failed: Stays on overlay, tries again

### Scenario 2: Connection Restored Automatically

1. Player waiting on disconnection overlay
2. **Automatic ping** (every 5 seconds) detects connection
3. **Overlay automatically closes**
4. **Status indicator** changes to green "ONLINE"
5. **Brief message**: "Connection restored"
6. **Gameplay resumes** normally

### Scenario 3: Non-Authenticated Player (Demo Mode)

1. No auth token in localStorage
2. Connection lost
3. **Demo mode allowed** (no real money at risk)
4. **No overlay shown** (demo gameplay continues)
5. **Status indicator** still shows "OFFLINE" for awareness

## Testing Checklist

### ‚úÖ Test 1: Disconnect During Spin
1. Login as authenticated player
2. Start a spin
3. **Disconnect internet** (turn off WiFi)
4. **Expected:**
   - Current spin may fail
   - Next spin attempt is blocked
   - Persistent overlay appears
   - Status shows "OFFLINE"

### ‚úÖ Test 2: Reconnect After Disconnect
1. Continue from Test 1
2. Click "RETRY CONNECTION"
3. **Turn WiFi back on**
4. **Expected:**
   - Overlay closes
   - "Connection restored" message
   - Status shows "ONLINE"
   - Can spin again

### ‚úÖ Test 3: Demo Player (No Auth)
1. Logout or use incognito window
2. Play in demo mode
3. Disconnect internet
4. **Expected:**
   - Status shows "OFFLINE"
   - **Can still spin** (demo mode allowed)
   - No persistent overlay

### ‚úÖ Test 4: Status Indicator Updates
1. Watch top-right corner indicator
2. Disconnect/reconnect internet
3. **Expected:**
   - Changes to red "OFFLINE" within 5-10 seconds
   - Changes to green "ONLINE" when reconnected

### ‚úÖ Test 5: Server Down

## Configuration

### Timing Constants (in `ConnectionMonitor.js`):

```javascript
this.checkInterval = 5000;    // Check every 5 seconds
this.pingTimeout = 10000;     // Timeout after 10 seconds
```

**Adjust for production:**
- Decrease `checkInterval` to 3000 for faster detection
- Increase `pingTimeout` to 15000 for slower networks

### Health Endpoint:

Currently pings: `/health`

**Server must implement:**
```javascript
app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
    res.status(200).json({ status: 'ok' });
});
```
