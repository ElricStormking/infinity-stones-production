# Testing Bugs - Hotfix Complete

**Date:** October 22, 2025

## Issues Found During Testing

After implementing the initial fixes, testing revealed 3 critical issues:

### 1. ❌ No Initial Grid Showing
**Symptom:** When player enters game for first time, grid is completely blank (black screen).

**Root Cause:** `/api/game-state` endpoint returned 404 for new players because:
- No game state existed in database
- Code returned error instead of creating initial state
- Grid generation logic never executed

### 2. ❌ Wrong Balance Display  
**Symptom:** Player `qaplayer21` showed $5000 balance instead of actual $1000.

**Root Cause:** Same as #1 - 404 from game-state endpoint caused client to fall back to demo balance of $5000.

### 3. ❌ Purchase Endpoint Error
**Symptom:** Purchase button showed error: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'FREE_SPINS')`

**Root Cause:** `GAME_CONFIG` was not exported from `gameEngine.js`, causing:
```javascript
const GAME_CONFIG = require('../game/gameEngine').GAME_CONFIG; // undefined
const FREE_SPINS_COUNT = GAME_CONFIG.FREE_SPINS.BUY_FEATURE_SPINS; // TypeError
```

---

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Export GAME_CONFIG (`infinity-storm-server/src/game/gameEngine.js`)

**Change:**
```javascript
module.exports = GameEngine;
module.exports.GAME_CONFIG = GAME_CONFIG; // ADDED THIS LINE
```

**Why:** Allows other modules to import the game configuration constants.

### Fix 2: Handle Missing Game State in getGameState() (`infinity-storm-server/src/controllers/game.js`)

**Problem:** Original code only checked StateManager (which doesn't exist in fallback mode) and returned 404 if no state found.

**Solution:** Added comprehensive fallback logic:

1. **Check if in fallback mode** (`SKIP_REDIS=true`)
2. **Query Supabase directly** for game state
3. **If no state exists (PGRST116 error)**, create initial state:
   ```javascript
   {
     player_id: playerId,
     session_id: null,
     game_mode: 'base',
     free_spins_remaining: 0,
     accumulated_multiplier: 1.00,
     state_data: {},
     created_at: NOW,
     updated_at: NOW
   }
   ```
4. **Insert into database** and use for response

**Code Location:** Lines 784-892

---

### Fix 3: Handle Raw Supabase Data Format

**Problem:** In fallback mode, Supabase returns raw JSON objects, not Sequelize model instances. The code called `gameState.getSafeData()` which doesn't exist on raw objects.

**Solution:** Added type checking and manual safe data creation:

```javascript
// Extract safe data - handle both Sequelize models and raw Supabase data
let safeData;
if (typeof gameState.getSafeData === 'function') {
  safeData = gameState.getSafeData(); // Sequelize model
} else {
  // Raw Supabase data - create safe data format manually
  safeData = {
    id: gameState.id,
    player_id: gameState.player_id,
    session_id: gameState.session_id,
    game_mode: gameState.game_mode || 'base',
    free_spins_remaining: gameState.free_spins_remaining || 0,
    accumulated_multiplier: gameState.accumulated_multiplier || 1.00,
    state_data: gameState.state_data || {},
    created_at: gameState.created_at,
    updated_at: gameState.updated_at
  };
}
```

**Code Location:** Lines 875-892

## How This Resolves The Issues

### ✅ Issue 1: No Initial Grid
1. First-time player loads game
2. Client calls `/api/game-state`
3. **NEW:** Server creates initial game state in database
4. Server generates initial grid (existing code, lines 909-928)
5. Returns grid in `state_data.current_grid`
6. Client receives grid and displays it

### ✅ Issue 2: Wrong Balance
1. First-time player loads game
2. `/api/game-state` now succeeds (doesn't return 404)
3. Server fetches actual balance from `players` table: $1000 (existing code, lines 896-907)
4. Returns balance in response
5. Client extracts and displays correct balance (existing code from first fix)

### ✅ Issue 3: Purchase Error
1. Player clicks purchase button
2. Client calls `/api/buy-feature`
3. **NEW:** `GAME_CONFIG.FREE_SPINS` is defined (exported)
4. Endpoint successfully calculates:
   - `FREE_SPINS_COUNT = 15`
   - `COST_MULTIPLIER = 100`
5. Purchase proceeds successfully

## Files Modified

### Server-side
- `infinity-storm-server/src/game/gameEngine.js`
  - Line 947: Added `module.exports.GAME_CONFIG = GAME_CONFIG;`

- `infinity-storm-server/src/controllers/game.js`
  - Lines 784-892: Rewrote `getGameState()` method to:
    - Query Supabase directly in fallback mode
    - Create initial game state if missing
    - Handle both Sequelize and raw Supabase data formats

---

## Testing Checklist

### ✅ Test 1: First-Time Player Login
1. Create new player (e.g., `qaplayer22`)
2. Login and open game
3. **Expected:** Grid shows random symbols (not blank)
4. **Expected:** Balance shows correct amount from database

### ✅ Test 2: Balance Display
1. Login as existing player with known balance (e.g., qaplayer21 with $1000)
2. Check balance display in game
3. **Expected:** Shows $1000, not $5000

### ✅ Test 3: Free Spins Purchase
1. Login as player with sufficient balance (≥ $100 for 1x bet)
2. Click "Purchase" button
3. Click "PURCHASE FREE SPINS" in confirmation dialog
4. **Expected:** Purchase succeeds, no error
5. **Expected:** Balance decreases by $100
6. **Expected:** Free spins mode starts with 15 spins

## Server Log Verification

After fix, logs should show:
```
[GET GAME STATE] No game state found for player, creating initial state
[GET GAME STATE] No current_grid found, generating initial grid
[GET GAME STATE] Initial grid saved to database
[GET GAME STATE] Player balance: 1000
```

And NO:
```
GET /api/game-state HTTP/1.1" 404
Feature purchase error ... Cannot read properties of undefined
```
