# Auth Token Fix - Complete

## Problem
The token was being loaded from localStorage successfully, but then `validateStoredToken()` was failing (because `/api/validate-session` endpoint returns 400) and calling `handleAuthError()` which cleared the token!

## Root Cause
In `NetworkService.initializeAuth()`:
```javascript
if (storedToken) {
    this.authToken = storedToken;
    // This was calling validateStoredToken which cleared the token!
    setTimeout(() => this.validateStoredToken(), 100);
}
```

The validation was failing because the session validation endpoint doesn't work in fallback mode, so it was clearing the token we just loaded!

## Fix Applied
1. **Modified `validateStoredToken()`**: Now it logs validation failures but does NOT clear the token in fallback mode
2. **Added comprehensive logging**: All auth operations now log with `[AUTH]` prefix
3. **Added player ID to transaction history**: Shows which player made each spin

## Files Changed
- `src/services/NetworkService.js`: Fixed token validation to not clear token on failure
- `src/managers/UIManager.js`: Added player_id column to transaction history

## Testing Steps
1. **Hard refresh**: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
2. **Login**: Go to `/test-player-login.html`, login as `qa_manual_01`
3. **Open game**: Navigate to game page
4. **Check console**: Should see:
   ```
   [AUTH] Token set and stored: eyJhbGci...
   [AUTH] NetworkService.authToken is now: SET
   [AUTH] Validating token...
   [AUTH] Token validation failed - KEEPING token anyway (fallback mode)
   ```
5. **Make a spin**: Check console should show:
   ```
   [AUTH] NetworkService.processSpin: authToken=EXISTS, isDemoSession=false, endpoint=/api/spin
   ```
6. **Check Supabase**: `spin_results` should show YOUR player_id (not demo_player)
7. **Check transaction history**: In-game menu should show player IDs

## Expected Result
- Spins use `/api/spin` endpoint (not `/api/demo-spin`)
- Supabase records show correct player_id
- Transaction history displays player ID for each spin
