# Database Connection Fix - COMPLETE ✅

## 🔴 Root Cause Found!

Your 401 authentication errors were caused by **incorrect database configuration** in `.env`:

### Before (Broken):
```env
DB_HOST=postgres          ❌ (hostname doesn't resolve!)
DB_PORT=5432             ❌ (wrong port)
DATABASE_URL=...localhost:5439...  ❌ (wrong database)
```

**Result**: Server couldn't connect to database → Session lookups failed → 401 errors → Switched to demo mode

### After (Fixed):
```env
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1        ✅ (Supabase local)
DB_PORT=54322            ✅ (correct port)
DB_NAME=postgres         ✅ (correct database)
DB_PASSWORD=postgres     ✅ (correct password)
```

## ✅ What Was Fixed

1. **Updated `.env` configuration** to point to correct Supabase local database (127.0.0.1:54322)
2. **Restarted server** to load new configuration
3. **Demo mode balance updates** now work correctly

## 🧪 Test Now!

### Step 1: Clear Your Session
Open console (F12) and run:
```javascript
localStorage.clear();
location.reload();
```

### Step 2: Login Again
1. Go to: **http://localhost:3000/test-player-login.html**
2. Click: **"Login as Test Player"**
3. Should see: ✅ Login Success! (no 401 errors)

### Step 3: Play Game
1. Click: **"→ Open Game"**
2. Or go to: **http://localhost:3000/**
3. **Play a spin**
4. **Check balance updates!**

## 🎯 Expected Results

### Server Mode (After Login):
```
✅ No 401 errors in console
✅ "Server mode enabled: true"
✅ Balance: $10000.00 (from server)
✅ After win: Balance updates correctly
✅ Console: "💵 Setting balance from server"
```

### Demo Mode (No Login):
```
✅ Balance: $10000.00 (local)
✅ After win: Balance updates correctly  
✅ Console: "💰 Client mode: Added win to balance"
```

## 🔧 What Changed

### 1. Database Configuration
**File**: `infinity-storm-server/.env`
- Fixed DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_NAME, DATABASE_URL

### 2. Demo Mode Balance Sync
**File**: `src/scenes/GameScene.js`
- Added WalletAPI sync when bet is placed (Line 1116)
- Added WalletAPI sync when win is added (Line 2074)

### 3. Server Mode Balance Sync
**File**: `src/scenes/GameScene.js`
- Added WalletAPI sync in 8 locations where server sends balance

## 🐛 If Still Not Working

### Check 1: Server Connected to Correct DB?
```powershell
cd d:\infinity-gauntlet\infinity-storm-server
node test-db-connections.js
```

Should show:
```
✅ Supabase Local (54322)
   Active sessions: [number]
   Testplayer exists: Yes
```

### Check 2: Clear Browser Data Completely
```javascript
// In console (F12):
localStorage.clear();
sessionStorage.clear();
location.reload();
```

### Check 3: Server Really Restarted?
```powershell
taskkill /F /IM node.exe
cd d:\infinity-gauntlet\infinity-storm-server
npm run dev
```

Wait 5 seconds, then try login again.

## 📊 Verification

After login and playing a spin, check console for:

**Server Mode**:
```
💵 [processServerSpin] Setting balance from server: 9991.5
💰 [WalletAPI] Balance set: $10,000.00 → $9,991.50
```

**Demo Mode**:
```
💰 Placed bet locally: { before: 10000, bet: 1, after: 9999 }
💰 [WalletAPI] Balance set: $10,000.00 → $9,999.00
💰 Client mode: Added win to balance: { win: 8.5, before: 9999, after: 10007.5 }
💰 [WalletAPI] Balance set: $9,999.00 → $10,007.50
```
