# Financial Transactions Table Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive `financial_transactions` table to record all player balance changes for complete audit trail and accounting purposes.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
**File:** `infinity-storm-server/src/db/migrations/003_financial_transactions.sql`

Created new table with:
- All transaction types: bet_deduction, win_payout, free_spins_purchase, portal_deposit, portal_withdrawal, adjustment, bonus_credit
- Balance tracking (before/after)
- Reference IDs for linking to spins, purchases, etc.
- JSONB metadata field for additional details
- Constraint to validate balance calculations
- Indexes for performance on player_id, created_at, transaction_type, and reference_id

### 2. Service Layer
**File:** `infinity-storm-server/src/services/financialTransactionLogger.js`

Created logging functions:
- `logBetDeduction()` - Logs bet deductions
- `logWinPayout()` - Logs win payouts
- `logFreeSpinsPurchase()` - Logs free spins purchases
- `logPortalDeposit()` - Logs portal deposits
- `logPortalWithdrawal()` - Logs portal withdrawals
- `logAdjustment()` - Logs manual balance adjustments
- `logBonusCredit()` - Logs bonus credits

**Key Features:**
- Automatically skips logging for demo players
- Handles both Redis and Supabase fallback modes
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Consistent data formatting

### 3. Integration Points

#### Game Controller (Spin Processing)
**File:** `infinity-storm-server/src/controllers/game.js`

- Added financial logging after bet deduction (lines 260-286)
- Added financial logging after win payout (lines 385-411)
- Logs both skipRedis and normal mode transactions
- References spin ID for audit trail

#### Purchase Endpoint
**File:** `infinity-storm-server/src/routes/api.js`

- Added financial logging after free spins purchase deduction (lines 570-577)
- Skips logging for demo mode purchases
- Records purchase cost and balance changes

#### Portal Endpoints
**File:** `infinity-storm-server/src/routes/portal.js`

- Added financial logging for portal deposits (lines 142-149)
- Links to portal transaction ID for reference

### 4. Migration Applied
Successfully ran migration to create the `financial_transactions` table in Supabase with all indexes and constraints.

## Transaction Types

| Type | Description | Amount Sign |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| bet_deduction | Player places a bet | Negative |
| win_payout | Player wins credits | Positive |
| free_spins_purchase | Player purchases free spins | Negative |
| portal_deposit | Credits transferred from portal | Positive |
| portal_withdrawal | Credits transferred to portal | Negative |
| adjustment | Manual balance correction | +/- |
| bonus_credit | Promotional credits | Positive |

## Demo Mode Handling
- Demo players (player_id === 'demo-player') are automatically excluded from financial transaction logging
- This prevents unnecessary database records for test/demo gameplay
- Transaction returns `{ success: true, skipped: true, reason: 'demo_player' }`

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Bet Deduction Logging**
   - Place a real money bet
   - Verify financial_transactions record created with:
     - transaction_type: 'bet_deduction'
     - Negative amount
     - Correct balance_before and balance_after
     - Reference to spin_id

2. **Win Payout Logging**
   - Complete a winning spin
   - Verify financial_transactions record created with:
     - transaction_type: 'win_payout'
     - Positive amount
     - Correct balance_before and balance_after
     - Reference to spin_id

3. **Free Spins Purchase Logging**
   - Purchase free spins
   - Verify financial_transactions record created with:
     - transaction_type: 'free_spins_purchase'
     - Negative amount (cost)
     - Correct balance_before and balance_after

4. **Portal Deposit Logging**
   - Use portal credit endpoint
   - Verify financial_transactions record created with:
     - transaction_type: 'portal_deposit'
     - Positive amount
     - Correct balance_before and balance_after
     - Reference to portal transaction_id

5. **Demo Mode Exclusion**
   - Play as demo player
   - Verify NO financial_transactions records are created
   - Check server logs for "Skipping financial transaction log for demo player"

6. **Balance Calculation Constraint**
   - Try to manually insert invalid data: `balance_after â‰  balance_before + amount`
   - Verify database constraint prevents invalid records

## Query Examples

```sql
-- Get all transactions for a player
SELECT * FROM financial_transactions 
WHERE player_id = 'player-uuid' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Get total bet amount for a player
SELECT SUM(ABS(amount)) FROM financial_transactions 
WHERE player_id = 'player-uuid' 
AND transaction_type = 'bet_deduction';

-- Get total winnings for a player
SELECT SUM(amount) FROM financial_transactions 
WHERE player_id = 'player-uuid' 
AND transaction_type = 'win_payout';

-- Get all transactions for a specific spin
SELECT * FROM financial_transactions 
WHERE reference_id = 'spin-uuid' 
ORDER BY created_at;

-- Audit report: All transactions in date range
SELECT 
  transaction_type,
  COUNT(*) as transaction_count,
  SUM(amount) as total_amount
FROM financial_transactions 
WHERE created_at BETWEEN '2025-01-01' AND '2025-01-31'
GROUP BY transaction_type;
```

## Files Modified

1. `infinity-storm-server/src/db/migrations/003_financial_transactions.sql` (NEW)
2. `infinity-storm-server/src/services/financialTransactionLogger.js` (NEW)
3. `infinity-storm-server/src/controllers/game.js` (MODIFIED)
4. `infinity-storm-server/src/routes/api.js` (MODIFIED)
5. `infinity-storm-server/src/routes/portal.js` (MODIFIED)

## Next Steps

- Monitor financial_transactions table in production
- Set up automated reports/dashboards for financial reconciliation
- Add withdrawal endpoint if needed (currently only deposit is implemented)
- Consider adding indexes for specific query patterns if performance issues arise
- Implement admin tools to query and export financial transaction data
