# Balance, Grid, Purchase, and Free Spins Bugs - Fix Complete

**Date:** October 22, 2025

## Summary

Fixed 4 critical bugs related to player balance display, initial grid generation, free spins purchase implementation, and balance deduction during free spins mode.

---

## Bug 1: Balance UI Not Showing on Game Entry ✅

**Problem:** Player's actual balance from the database wasn't displayed when entering the game from the title menu.

**Root Cause:** Balance wasn't being extracted from all possible response formats, and the server wasn't including it in the game state response.

**Fixes Applied:**

### Client-side (`src/scenes/GameScene.js`)
- Enhanced `fetchInitialServerState()` to extract balance from multiple response formats:
  - `response.balance`
  - `response.data.balance`
  - `gameState.balance`
  - `gameState.state_data.balance`
  - `gameState.credits` (fallback)
- Added comprehensive debug logging to trace balance extraction
- Ensured `updateBalanceDisplay()` is called after setting balance from server

### Server-side (`infinity-storm-server/src/controllers/game.js`)
- Modified `getGameState()` endpoint to fetch player balance from Supabase
- Added balance to response in multiple formats for client compatibility:
  - `response.balance`
  - `response.gameState.balance`
  - `response.gameState.credits`
- Added debug logging for balance retrieval

## Bug 2: Blank Initial Grid ✅

**Problem:** When a player entered the base game from the title menu, the grid was completely blank (no symbols).

**Root Cause:** Server returned no `current_grid` in `state_data`, and client had no fallback to generate one.

**Fixes Applied:**

### Client-side (`src/scenes/GameScene.js`)
- Modified `applyServerGameState()` to generate a fallback grid when none exists:
  - Checks for `options.initial` flag
  - Calls `gridManager.fillGrid()` to generate random symbols
  - Starts idle animations for visual appeal
- Existing calls to `applyServerGameState()` already pass `{ initial: true }`

### Server-side (`infinity-storm-server/src/controllers/game.js`)
- Modified `getGameState()` endpoint to generate initial grid if missing:
  - Uses `gameEngine.gridGenerator.generateGrid()` with constraints:
    - `forceNonWinning: true` - ensures no winning clusters
    - `maxScatters: 3` - prevents triggering free spins on load
  - Saves generated grid to database in fallback mode
  - Adds grid to `state_data.current_grid` in response

## Bug 3: Free Spins Purchase Cost Not Deducted ✅

**Problem:** When purchasing free spins through the purchase button, the cost wasn't deducted from the player's balance, and the server didn't recognize the purchase.

**Root Cause:** The `/api/buy-feature` endpoint was not implemented, returning "not implemented" error. Client was deducting balance locally without server validation.

**Fixes Applied:**

### Server-side (`infinity-storm-server/src/routes/api.js`)
- Implemented complete `/api/buy-feature` endpoint:
  1. **Validates feature type** (only `free_spins` supported)
  2. **Fetches player balance** from Supabase
  3. **Verifies sufficient balance** for purchase
  4. **Deducts cost** from player's credits in database
  5. **Creates transaction record** in `transactions` table with type `purchase`
  6. **Updates game state** in `game_states` table:
     - Sets `game_mode: 'free_spins'`
     - Sets `free_spins_remaining` to 15 (from `GAME_CONFIG.FREE_SPINS.BUY_FEATURE_SPINS`)
     - Resets `accumulated_multiplier` to 1.00
     - Adds purchase metadata to `state_data`
  7. **Returns comprehensive response** with new balance, free spins count, and mode

### Client-side (`src/services/NetworkService.js`)
- Added `purchaseFreeSpins(featureType, cost)` method
- POSTs to `/api/buy-feature` with feature type and cost
- Returns server response with balance and free spins state

### Client-side (`src/managers/FreeSpinsManager.js`)
- Refactored purchase button handler to be `async`
- Changed flow from:
  1. ❌ Deduct balance locally
  2. ❌ Show free spins UI
- To:
  1. ✅ Close purchase UI
  2. ✅ Call `NetworkService.purchaseFreeSpins()` and await response
  3. ✅ Update balance from server response
  4. ✅ Update local free spins state BEFORE first spin
  5. ✅ Show free spins UI
- Added error handling for purchase failures

## Bug 4: Balance Deducted During Free Spins Mode ✅

**Problem:** After purchasing free spins, the player's balance was still being deducted on every spin during free spins mode.

**Root Cause:** Server wasn't recognizing that the player was in free spins mode because the game state update from the purchase happened asynchronously.

**Fixes Applied:**

### Already Fixed by Bug 3
The fix for Bug 3 inherently solves Bug 4:

1. **Purchase endpoint updates database synchronously** before returning
   - `game_mode` set to `'free_spins'`
   - `free_spins_remaining` set to 15
   - State persisted to `game_states` table

2. **First spin after purchase loads fresh state**
   - `processSpin()` reads from `game_states` table (line 182-196)
   - Correctly identifies `game_mode === 'free_spins'` and `free_spins_remaining > 0`
   - Sets `serverFreeSpinsActive = true` (line 210)

3. **Bet deduction is skipped** (line 231)
   - Condition: `if (!player.is_demo && !serverFreeSpinsActive)`
   - Since `serverFreeSpinsActive` is `true`, bet deduction is skipped

### Fallback Safety Net
Additionally, existing fallback logic (lines 219-226) handles edge cases where client is ahead of server:
- If client reports free spins active but server doesn't know, server trusts client
- Useful for race conditions or state sync delays

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Balance Display Test**
   - Log in as existing player (e.g., `qaplayer12`)
   - Navigate from title menu to base game
   - Verify balance displays correctly (not 0 or undefined)
   - Check browser console for balance extraction logs

2. **Initial Grid Test**
   - Log in as new player or player with no saved grid
   - Navigate from title menu to base game
   - Verify grid shows random symbols (not blank)
   - Verify symbols are non-winning and <4 scatters
   - Check idle animations are playing

3. **Free Spins Purchase Test**
   - Log in with sufficient balance (e.g., 500 credits)
   - Click "Free Spins Purchase" button
   - Enter base game and click purchase button
   - Verify:
     - Purchase UI closes
     - Balance is deducted (cost = currentBet × 100)
     - Free spins mode UI appears
     - Free spins counter shows 15 spins
   - Check server logs for purchase transaction

4. **No Bet During Free Spins Test**
   - Continue from step 3 (in free spins mode)
   - Click spin button
   - Verify:
     - Balance does NOT decrease
     - Free spins counter decrements from 15 → 14
     - Accumulated multiplier badge visible
   - Check server logs show "will skip bet: true"

## Configuration Used

- **Free Spins Count:** 15 spins (`GAME_CONFIG.FREE_SPINS.BUY_FEATURE_SPINS`)

## Notes

2. Purchase transactions are recorded in `transactions` table for audit
3. Grid generation respects game rules (non-winning, <4 scatters)
4. Balance updates are server-authoritative (client syncs from response)
5. Free spins state is persisted to database before first spin
